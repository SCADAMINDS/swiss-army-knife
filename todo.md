# TODO list
- Change Name? SwissArmyKnife is obviously taken

## Docs

- link to doc pages in readme
- Have doxygen run in a github action so we don't need to look at those wild diffs all the time

## Other
- Publish to nuget on new releases
- block pushes to main


## Tests missing
- Test HttpResponseMessageExtensions
- Test ObjectExtensions
- Test FluentTaskExtensions
